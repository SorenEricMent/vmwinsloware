A dumb VM for UBC CPSC 121's prelab 8 assignment in JavaScript

Overkill for Lab 8, done by Winslow Hu. 

**For educational purposes, using it as a UBC student in CPSC 121 might break academic integrity!**

## How to use:
Edit the init memory

Use NodeJS to execute index.js, so `node index.js`

## TODO: 
1. Extend the Instruction set to add memory rw
2. Make the given instructions programmable so that even the mapping for instructions from icd and ifn changed this VM could quickly adapt
3. Eat more Lasagna
